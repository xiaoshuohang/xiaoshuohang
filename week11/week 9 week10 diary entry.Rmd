## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
"Q1:the topic i decide to choose is about the conditions of marine species, this topic is discussed from various perspectives such as the pollution situation, the distinction rates and so on"

"Q2:I have collected several data resoureces on different websites, mostly CSV files, below is one of the datasets i have found."

read.csv("marine1.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
"week 10:"
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
