## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
"Q1:the topic i decide to choose is about the conditions of marine species, this topic is discussed from various perspectives such as the pollution situation, the distinction rates and so on"

"Q2:I have collected several data resoureces on different websites, mostly CSV files, below is one of the datasets i have found."

read.csv("marine1.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r}
"week 10"
"The question i am going to answer is What secrets do the depths of the ocean hold about today's marine conditions?"
"According to research done by the University of Texas at Austin,  “As the growing global population stresses the ability of our society to produce food, water, and shelter, we will continue to look to the oceans to help sustain our basic needs.”
According to UN,The ocean is one of the main repositories of the world's biodiversity. It constitutes 
over 90 per cent of the habitable space on the planet and contains some 250,000 known species, with many more remaining to be discovered—at least two thirds of the world's marine species are still unidentified.1
According to Scientia pakistan,Marine biology is interlinked with other science fields like astronomy, biological oceanography, cellular biology, chemistry, ecology, geology, physical oceanography, and zoology. It helps to study the behaviors and interactions of these living entities."
"One of the chanllenges i faced is to download the shiny app and a also cleaning the data for now"

"week 11"
'The variables i am going to plot are latitude, longitude and count of species. This will show a relationship between the depth of the ocean and the marine conditions.'
 "I want to adapt the shiny and ggplot ro make it interactive. As the user of my website can slide the bar to see the changes and thus have a more obvious observation about the marine conditions."

 
  data <- data.frame(
  Week = c("week 9", "week 7","week 8"),
  Content = c("tidy data", "ggplot2 package", "Shiny"))





```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
